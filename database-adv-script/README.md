# SQL Joins Practice

This project is for practicing SQL joins.

## Database Setup
1. Create a database called `shop_db`.
2. Create the following tables:
   - `users`
   - `bookings`
   - `properties`
   - `reviews`

## Tasks Practiced
1. **INNER JOIN**  
   Query to get all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

2. **LEFT JOIN**  
   Query to get all properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews.

3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**  
   Query to get all users and all bookings, even if a user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.
